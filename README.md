### Some things to be noted:
- Idea and design from [Codesistency](https://www.youtube.com/@codesistency).
- Feel free to use and improve my source code.
- Please don't attack on me I'm new to this trio of code D:

### Possible future changes:
- Right now I didn't really add any type checking for the *description* and *amount* input yet so currently it will cause
some problems if you decided to use inputs like **01923ik1231p23-1212p3###** for the amount lol.
